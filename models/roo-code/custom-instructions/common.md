When implementing code, please follow these guidelines:
1. Implement code based on user requirements.
2. Before implementation, identify design patterns that are adopted in the project or applicable, and strive to adhere to them. Do not limit yourself to specific patterns; consider appropriate patterns according to the project's architecture and coding conventions.
3. If your proposed implementation deviates from existing design patterns:
   * Clearly explain how it deviates
   * Explain why it deviates (technical constraints, performance reasons, etc.)
   * Present options for addressing this: a) An alternative implementation method that adheres to the design pattern b) The advantages and disadvantages of accepting the deviation
   * Ask the user for their choice
4. When providing code, briefly explain the reasons for the design patterns and architectural decisions adopted.
5. Include comments in the code to explain important decisions and complex logic.
